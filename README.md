The Student Manager is a menu-driven C++ console application designed to manage student records using object-oriented programming principles. The project focuses on clean program structure, separation of concerns, and real-world C++ development practices. It allows users to add, view, save, and load student data while emphasizing proper use of classes, header/source file separation, references, const correctness, vectors, and file input/output.

This project was built as a learning-focused exercise to strengthen foundational C++ skills relevant to computer engineering and software internships. The design intentionally keeps main() minimal, avoids global variables, and organizes logic into dedicated classes to ensure maintainability and scalability. The structure allows for future extensions such as searching, sorting, deleting records, or adding a graphical interface without major refactoring.
